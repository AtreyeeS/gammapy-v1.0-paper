@article{fits,
	Abstract = {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) has been used by astronomers for over 30 years as a data interchange and archiving format; FITS files are now handled by a wide range of astronomical software packages. Since the FITS format definition document (the ``standard'') was last printed in this journal in 2001, several new features have been developed and standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables, and new world coordinate system conventions which provide a mapping from an element in a data array to a physical coordinate on the sky or within a spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo further evolution, in which case the latest version may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/">http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/</ext-link>, which also provides many links to FITS-related resources.},

An associated library of computational algorithms and         visualization software supports fast scientific applications         executable directly on discretized spherical maps generated from         very large volumes of astronomical data. Originally developed to         address the data processing and analysis needs of the present         generation of cosmic microwave background experiments (e.g.,         BOOMERANG, WMAP), HEALPix can be expanded to meet many of the         profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the         observational output of future missions and experiments,         including, e.g., Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond         Einstein inflation probe. In this paper we consider the         requirements and implementation constraints on a framework that         simultaneously enables an efficient discretization with         associated hierarchical indexation and fast analysis/synthesis         of functions defined on the sphere. We demonstrate how these are         explicitly satisfied by HEALPix.},
