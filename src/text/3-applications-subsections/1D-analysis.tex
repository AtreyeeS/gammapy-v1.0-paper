\subsection{1D Analysis}
\label{ssec:1d-analysis}
One of the most common analysis cases in \gammaray astronomy is measuring the
spectrum of a source in a given region defined on the sky, in conventional
astronomy also called aperture photometry. The spectrum is typically measured
in two steps: first a parametric spectral model is fitted to the data and
secondly flux points are computed in a pre-defined set of energy bins. The
result of such an analysis performed on three simulated CTA observations is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cta_galactic_center}. In this case the spectrum was
measured in a circular aperture centered on the Galactic Center, in
\gammaray~astronomy often called "on region". For such analysis the users first
chooses a region of interest and energy binning, both defined by a
\code{RegionGeom}. In a second step the events and instrument response are binned
into maps of this geometry, by the \code{SpectrumDatasetMaker}. All the data and
reduced instrument response are bundled into a \code{SpectrumDataset}. To estimate
the expected background in the on region a "reflected regions" background
method was used~\cite{Berge07}, represented in \gammapy by the
\code{ReflectedRegionsBackgroundMaker} class. The resulting reflected regions are
illustrated for all three observations on top of the map of counts. After
reduction of the data it was modelled using a forward-folding method and a
power-law spectral shape, using the \code{PowerLawSpectralModel} and \code{Fit} class.
Based on this best fit model the final flux points and corresponding
log-likelihood profiles are computed using the \code{FluxPointsEstimator}.
