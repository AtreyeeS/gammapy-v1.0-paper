\section{Applications}
\label{sec:apps}

Each application example is a notebook in the online material: We could have one
analysis as Python scripts instead of notebook in the online material. At the
start of this section, point to gammapy-paper repo on Github and say that
thereâ€™s a Binder where people can try the examples online.

TODO: mention other application examples (joint Crab paper, HESS validation
paper, HGPS, ...) here or in a subsection "other applications" at the end of
this section?

Gammapy data model illustration. Binned analysis of lon-lat-energy cube data is
supported via joint likelihood analysis of one image per energy bin.
On-off-region based spectral analysis is supported as well.
